# 1.1 Real Numbers
## Basics 
* The set of all numbers, that are not complex
* Rational - can be expressed as fraction
* Natural Numbers - all positive starting from 1, 2, 3...
* Integers - All Natural and their negative counterparts including 0.
* Irrational - can't be expressed as fraction. generally math symbols such as `pi` or inside square roots.

Every real number has a decimal representation, which is repeating.
<br>For example - `1/2 = 0.50000` or `157/495 = 0.3171717`. 
<br>By nature, every irrational number also has a decimal form, but it is non-repeating. 
<br>For example $\sqrt{2}$ = 1.414213562373095... or $\pi$ = 3.14159265...

## Properties of Real Numbers
Commutative, Associative and Distributive properties apply to all real numbers.

`-a` denotes both a negation operation and a negative real number. 

`The number 0 is the additive identity and the number 1 is the multiplicative identity.`

## The Real Line
* Origin is at 0. To the right are +ve values and to the left are -ve.
* Real numbers are _ordered_. When `a < b`, `b - a` is a positive number. Geometrically, this means that _a_ lies to the left of _b_ on the real line.

## Sets and Intervals

### Set Roster Notation
`A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`

### Set Builder Notation
`A = {x | x is an integer and 0 < x < 7}` which is read as _"A is a set of all x such that x is an integer and 0 < x < 7."_

### Intervals
* `(a, b) = {x | a < x < b}` called the open interval. Doesn't include endpoints a, b.
* <br>`[a,b] = {x | a <= x <= b}` called the closed interval. Includes endpoints a, b. 
* Any interval contains infinitely many numbers -- every point on the graph of an interval corresponds to a real number (subject to further classification such as integer/rational/irration, etc.)

`(1, 3) ∩ [2,7] = [2, 3)` which means include 2 since closed interval but don't include 3, rather 2.99 can also do.<br>
`(1, 3) ∪ [2,7] = (1, 7]` which means don't include 1 since open interval but include all from 2-7. 

### Absolute Value and Distance
`|a|` is the distance from _a_ to 0, which can always either be positive or zero, so we have `|a| >= 0` for every number _a_.

### Distance between points
If _a_ and _b_ are real numers, then the **distance** between the points _a_ and _b_ on the real line is <br>
`d(a, b) = |b - a|`

# 1.2 Exponents and Radicals

$(-3)^4$ and $-3^4$ are not the same as in the first, the exponent applies to `-3` which makes the value `81` and in the second, the exponent applies only to `3`, which makes the value `-81`. 

In general,
* $a^ma^n = a^{m+n}$
* ${a^m \over a^n} = a^{m-n}$
* $a^0 = 1$
* $a^{-n} = 1 / a^n$
* ${(a^m)^n} = a^{mn}$
* $(ab)^n = {a^n}{b^n}$
* $(a / b)^n = {{a^n} \over {b^n}}$

## Scientific Notation

$4 x 10^13$ which indicates that the decimal point should be moved 13 places to the _right_ ($40,000,000,000,000$).<br>
$1.66 x 10^-24$ which indicates that the decimal point should be moved 24 places to the _left_ (0.00000000000000000000000166). In other words, 23 places before 166.

$3.629 x 10^{15}$ can also be written as `3.629e15`.

## Radicals

$\sqrt[n]{a} = b$ means $b^n = a$<br>
For example, $\sqrt[4]{81} = 3$ and $\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2$<br>
But $\sqrt{-8}$, $\sqrt[4]{-8}$ and $\sqrt[6]{-8}$ are not defined. (For instance, $\sqrt{-8}$ is not defined because the square of every real number is nonnegative.

More generally,
* $\sqrt[n]{a^n} = a$ if n is odd. For example $\sqrt[3]{(-5)^3} = -5$
* $\sqrt[n]{a^n} = |a|$ if n is even. For example $\sqrt[4]{(-3)^4} = |-3| = 3$

### Combining Radicals
$\sqrt{25b} - \sqrt{b^3}$ = $\sqrt25\sqrt{b}$ - $\sqrt{b^2}\sqrt{b}$ = $5\sqrt{b}$ - $b\sqrt{b}$ = $(5-b)\sqrt{b}$

## Rational Exponents
$a^{1/n}$ = $\sqrt[n]{a}$ or more generally $a^{m/n}$ = $(\sqrt[n]{a})^m$ = $\sqrt[n]{a^m}$

$\frac{1}{2}$
